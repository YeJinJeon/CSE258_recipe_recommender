food.com recipe and review data:

1) Analyse what recipes to reccomend to people based on their ratings and review history
	- uses rating data (maybe LVM)
	- uses review data (maybe BOW etc.)
	- tags for recipe (also using BOW etc.)
   Could also analyse what data is more informative between the above two

2) Analyse what recipes to reccomend given the above reccomendations and a set of ingredients
	- simply filter based on ingredient
	- filter based on ingredient and still reccomend recipes with easy (common) ingredients
	- reccomend ingredients to get to make recipes that user would enjoy
   Could also analyse the drop in MSE when the recipes are filtered by ingredients
   Could analyse how well the extra ingredient reccomendations work based on how common/cheap ingredients 
   are and how well new list of recipes suits user rather than simply filtering

3) Also has nutritional values that we can make use of in the same way?

ADDITIONAL DATA: No of steps/ingredients, cook time, date added (could time forecast recipe popularity)
